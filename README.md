# myMovieTracker

technicalDetails:

I developed the entire app, including both the front-end and back-end, as well as the complete state management. Itâ€™s a fully custom-built project that allows me to track the movies I watch and monitor my viewing history. The application is still a work in progress, and this is just the first, more basic version. A movie tracking app where users can write reviews, add friends, and have a personalized feed based on their friends activities. Users can also keep a watchlist and track their movie history. The app is designed to help users manage their movie preferences, share recommendations with friends, and stay updated on the latest films they've watched or want to watch.

backend:
Honestly, once I had the entire backend set up, things became much easier. The biggest challenge was definitely getting everything off the ground especially with setting up authentication, the database, and middlewares. But once that foundation was in place, everything else started to fall into place and became much more manageable. The backend runs on Node.js and Express, offering a REST API to handle requests. Data is stored in PostgreSQL, which provides a reliable and scalable solution for managing user information, and movie data. For authentication, I implemented JSON Web Tokens (JWT) paired with bcrypt for secure password hashing.

frontend:
The frontend was developed using React and TypeScript, ensuring a dynamic and type-safe user experience. Zustand is used for state management, making the data flow more efficient. For styling, I used Bootstrap, enabling fast and easy design implementation. The app is populated with fake data generated by the Faker library, and for the database, I used The Movie Database (TMDB) API. The app is deployed on Render and Vercel for smooth and fast hosting. I also integrated the Framer Motion library for animations, used Lazy Loading to optimize performance, and implemented React Router for smooth and scalable routing.
